      I am a retired Army analyst still working for the Department of the Army.
                I studied code in an Army assignment and then attended the Georgia Tech Coding Boot Camp
                to hone my skills and rejoin the coding work force. I enjoy solving problems and understanding
                how technology works and creating an enjoyable workspace.
